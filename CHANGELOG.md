# Changelog

Notable changes to Hearth. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); semver is not strict pre-1.0.

## v0.7-preview

First public release. Windows-first; macOS/Linux support is partial.

### Interfaces
- CLI with a voice loop, command history, slash-command autocomplete, in-session model control, and a context-usage footer.
- Desktop app and web UI sharing the CLI backend: multi-chat sidebar, a Models tab for downloading and loading GGUFs with per-model load settings, voice mode, file drop, inline permission prompts, and a settings panel.
- Headless bridge (`python -m hearth.headless`) that runs a single prompt non-interactively and emits JSONL events to stdout.
- MCP server (`python -m hearth.mcp_server`) exposing every built-in tool to MCP-aware chat hosts.

### Models
- Runs against any OpenAI-compatible server. Auto-detects LM Studio, Ollama, and llama.cpp at boot.
- Optional bundled llama.cpp server installed via `install.ps1 -BuiltinLLM cuda|cpu`, so no separate LLM app is required. Preview-quality; tool-call reliability lags a dedicated runner.
- Optional cloud endpoints (Gemini, OpenAI, Grok, OpenRouter) selectable in Settings, switchable mid-session without restart.
- Tool-call parser that recognizes Gemma, Hermes, Qwen 2.5/3, Llama 3.x, Mistral, Phi, Granite, and Cohere Command-R formats plus a generic `<function=NAME>` form.

### Tools and capabilities
- File read/write/edit/list/move/delete. `read_file` extracts text from PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, IPYNB, CSV, JSON, HTML, RTF, and `.gz`/`.bz2`/`.xz`. Archive inspect/extract without unpacking. `summarize_file` for short summaries. `read_pdf_large` for map-reduce summarization of large PDFs.
- Shell command execution (PowerShell / cmd) with captured, sanitized output.
- App, file, folder, and URL launching with one tool.
- Real browser driving (Chrome / Brave / Edge): open a page, list clickable elements, click, type, scroll, with a persistent session across calls.
- Screenshot capture and image viewing through a vision-capable model.
- Web search and fetch via DuckDuckGo.
- Persistent per-fact memory with recall tracking, automatic cold-fact archiving and warm-back, and overlap detection on save.
- Reminders (one-shot and recurring) set in natural language, optionally firing a tool when due, with catch-up on next launch for reminders missed while closed (surfaced in the CLI chat, since Windows often suppresses the toast), an optional ntfy phone push, and their own sidebar tab in the desktop app.
- Skills: prose+script workflow bundles the model loads on demand. Built-in skills generate documents (PDF, PPTX, XLSX, diagrams, ASCII art, PDF split/merge). **Shareable**: install a skill from a GitHub repo or local path with `/skill install <source>` (or the `install_skill` tool when a link is pasted in chat) — install discloses the declared tools + shipped scripts and asks before writing; scripts run only through the normal command-permission prompt. Scaffold your own with `/skill new`; the assistant can also author one when it notices a repeated workflow.
- Sub-agents (researcher, coder, archivist, librarian, summarizer, PDF coordinator) with per-agent tool allowlists and a tightened prompt, runnable synchronously or in the background with results delivered on the next turn. Fork depth is bounded.
- Background jobs for long-running operations, returning a job id immediately.
- MCP client: consume other MCP servers via an `mcp.json` in the workspace, surfacing their tools alongside the built-ins.
- Voice: streaming Kokoro text-to-speech and faster-whisper speech-to-text with continuous-listen barge-in and optional wake word. CUDA auto-detect; CPU by default. Preview-quality.
- Self-extending tools: the assistant can author a validated plugin to fill a capability gap; hand-written plugins auto-load from the workspace.
- A `soul.md` self-identity file loaded into every prompt, and end-to-end agent rename (avatar, persona, and workspace folder).
- Optional cloud image/video generation and local Stable Diffusion (Forge) image generation.
- Memory migration from prior agent layouts (API keys are never copied), including pasting a memory dump from ChatGPT/Claude.
- Phone reach: a Telegram bridge (bot token only, no OAuth) to message Hearth from your phone — it runs the full agent on your PC and replies, files included, gated by a chat-id allowlist.
- Opt-in auto-update: check GitHub for a newer release and install (`/update` in the CLI, a button in Settings).
- Optionally launch at login (desktop tray), so reminders fire before you open Hearth.

### Behavior
- Default tool set is trimmed to a core group; niche tools are revealed on demand via a `load_tools` meta-tool to keep the prompt small. `HEARTH_ALL_TOOLS=1` loads everything up front.
- A loop guard detects and breaks repeated, no-progress, or ping-pong tool-call patterns.
- Writes confined to the workspace by default; risky tools prompt for permission per session, and permission decisions persist and are shared between the CLI and the app.
- Procedural local time injected into the system prompt each turn.

## 0.5.0

- CLI as the primary interface, with voice in/out, permission prompts, and context auto-detection.
- Desktop app (native window) and web UI sharing one backend; system tray; optional wake word.
- File reading across PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/EPUB/IPYNB/CSV/JSON/HTML/RTF and archive inspect/extract.
- First-run onboarding wizard writing answers to memory and house rules.
- Smart file finder scanning non-system drives with kind hints.
- Headless bridge mode emitting JSONL events.

## 0.4.0

- First version cut for public release. Package renamed to `hearth`; the assistant persona remains JARVIS.
- Smart file finder, scoped search guards, voice input via faster-whisper, ambient interrupt, wake-word filter.
- LM Studio context auto-detection.
- Windows installer (`install.ps1`), MIT license, contributing/security docs, and CI smoke tests.
